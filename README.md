22. SORTING
 - Bubble Sort (Compare two element, swap if one is taller, with this the largest element will move to right)
   * Complexity - O(N^2) 
   * Comparisons - O(N^2) 
   * Swaps - O(N^2) 
   * Sort in place, meaning that, besides the initial array, very little extra memory is required
 - Selection Sort (Find min, swap with first and so on) (Less number of swaps)
   * Complexity - O(N^2) 
   * Comparisons - O(N^2) 
   * Swaps - O(N) 
   * Sort in place, meaning that, besides the initial array, very little extra memory is required
 - Insertion Sort
   * Complexity - O(N^2) 
   * Comparisons - O(N^2) 
   * Swaps - O(N^2) 
   * Sort in place, meaning that, besides the initial array, very little extra memory is required
